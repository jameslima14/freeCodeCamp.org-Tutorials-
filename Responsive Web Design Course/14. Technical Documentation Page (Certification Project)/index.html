        <p>
In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.</p>
        <p>You'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.</p>
        <li>A simple HTML example:</li>
        <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
      </section>

        <header>JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures</header>
        <p>In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.</p>
        <p>Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.</p>
        <li>JS Example:</li>
        <code>const main = document.GetElementByID('main')</code>
      </section>

      <section class='main-section' id='Data_Visualization'>
        <header>Data Visualization</header>
        <p>In the Data Visualization Certification, you'll build charts, graphs, and maps to present different types of data with the D3.js library.</p>
        <p>You'll also learn about JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), and how to work with data online using an API (Application Programming Interface).</p>

      </section>

      <section class='main-section' id='Back_End_Development_and_APIs'>
        <header>Back End Development and APIs</header>
        <p>In the Back End Development and APIs Certification, you'll learn how to write back end apps with Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). </p>
        <p>You'll also build web applications with the Express framework, and build a People Finder microservice with MongoDB and the Mongoose library.</p>
        <code></code>

      <section class='main-section' id='Machine_Learning_with_Python'>
        <header>Machine Learning with Python</header>
        <p>In the Machine Learning with Python Certification, you'll use the TensorFlow framework to build several neural networks and explore more advanced techniques like natural language processing and reinforcement learning.</p>
        <p>You'll also dive into neural networks, and learn the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks work.</p>
